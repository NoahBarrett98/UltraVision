When training it was found that using the test set yields very low acc,
it will be interesting to seee what happens if we use validation set -> which has augmentaiton applied to it. 

testing now with valiadtion loader to see the kind of loss we are experienceing will be interesting if it is similar 
to that of the paper, then we can question the strngth of this paper.

this was not the case, now im gonna try to run this with a different dataloader and see how it performs
